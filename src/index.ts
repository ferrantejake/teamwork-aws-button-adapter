/**
 * This is a sample Lambda function that sends an Email on click of a
 * button. It creates a SNS topic, subscribes an endpoint (EMAIL)
 * to the topic and publishes to the topic.
 *
 * Follow these steps to complete the configuration of your function:
 *ks
 * 1. Update the email environment variable with your email address.
 * 2. Enter a name for your execution role in the "Role name" field.
 *    Your function's execution role needs specific permissions for SNS operations
 *    to send an email. We have pre-selected the "AWS IoT Button permissions"
 *    policy template that will automatically add these permissions.
